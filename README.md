## How to Run the Script

1. Clone the repository or download the script file to your local machine.

2. Ensure the script file has execute permissions:

    ```bash
    chmod +x setup-dhis2.sh
    ```

3. Run the script with sudo privileges:

    ```bash
    sudo ./setup-dhis2.sh
    ```

4. The script will start executing and will log progress to the console. It may take several minutes to complete.

5. Once the script completes, you can access DHIS2 at:

    ```bash
    http://your_server_ip:8080/dhis
    ```

    Replace `your_server_ip` with the actual IP address of your server.
